<P> Flock allows users to find their friends and never get separated again. Users can either view their friend list and immediately see which eating club they are currently at, or view an attendance list at any given club. Flock uses the iPhone's built-in GPS to update each users location information dynamically and without any work on the user's end. Flock utilizes the Facebook SDK to make login and friendship information as seamless as possible for its user.

<P> How to access or create a running version of your system.
If your system is web-based, this should be a URL.
If your system is a phone application,
this should reference an installable version.
Don't forget to provide passwords, including administrative access, if we will need them
to experiment with your system.
<i> Please make this as easy for us as possible.</i>  There are 45 projects and if
we have to blow 15 minutes figuring out how to run your system, that's one very
long day wasted.

<P> Please contact our team manager, William Bertrand, for additional questions.

<P> These links must point to PDF files <b>with exactly the
specified names</b>.  They must not require logging into some place
like Google Docs or GitHub.  We need to have all submissions in
one place and completely uniform at this level so the TAs and I can
access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
