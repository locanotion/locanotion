<P> Flock allows users to find their friends and never get separated again. Users can either view their friend list and immediately see which eating club they are currently at, or view an attendance list at any given club. Flock uses the iPhone's built-in GPS to update each users location information dynamically and without any work on the user's end. Facebook integration makes login and friend-lists as seamless as possible for its user.

<P> Because Flock is an iOS application, there are limited ways for you to access a working version of our system right now. We have not released our app yet on the Mac Application Store because it would take a couple weeks to a month for Apple to even release our app. Therefore, in order to make it easy for you as graders, Will Bertrand has offered to let someone use his phone, which has Flock installed. Alternatively, we could add any individual grader(s) as a 'tester' who could download an unofficial version of Flock on their iPhone. We would probably have to personally install the app directly on to your device when connected to one of our computers. 

Lastly, to make your life as a grader easier, please let us know if we should add a new location to Flock so that you can test for that location. For example, we have used the "Cos Building" as a location for our demo, and have used "Wilcox" and "Frist" as test locations for convenience.

<P> Please contact our team manager, William Bertrand, for additional questions.
